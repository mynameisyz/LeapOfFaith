# LeapOfFaith
A Xbox Kinect enabled platform game powered by Unity game engine.

This game is produced for a diploma course Final Year Project in Temasek Polytechnic, Summer 2013. It has been chosen as one of the showcases opened to the general public and industry members during the annual TP InfoTech Day in 2013.

LeapOfFaith is a 2-player (online) cooperative platform game that pits 2 players to complete a series of puzzles. Players have no means of verbal or textual communication, so the only way to communicate is through gesturing and body language, enabled by Kinect. A short video demo: https://youtu.be/HRc3NjlXNOY

However, due to the apparant age of the project, and the fact that it relies on unoffical third-party XBox Kinect to Windows driver, it might be impossible to get this game running again.
